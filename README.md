# Mathametical Modelling-of-Induction-Motor
The dynamic simulation is one of the key steps in the validation of the design process of the motordrive system, 
which eliminates the designing mistakes and the resulting errors in the prototype construction and testing.The dynamic model of the 
induction motor in direct, quadrature, and zero-sequence axes can be derived 
from fundamental equations of transformation. The dynamic analysis of the symmetrical induction machines in 
the arbitrary reference frame has been intensively used as a standard simulation approach from which any 
particular mode of operation may then be developed. Matlab/Simulink has an advantage over other machine 
simulators in modelling the induction machine using dq0 axis transformation. Generally modelling of these 
equations is considered difficult so that in this paper they are presented in their simplified form. The 
transformations used at various steps are based on simple trigonometric relationship obtained as projections on a 
set of axes. The dynamic model is used to obtain transient responses, small signal equations, and a transfer 
function of induction motor. Dynamic models (mathematical models) are employed in to better understand the 
behaviour of induction motor in both transient and steady state. 
The dynamic modelling sets all the mechanical equations for the inertia, torque and speed versus time. 
It also models all the differential voltage, currents and flux linkages between the stationary stator as well as the 
moving rotor. This mathematical model has been done by using MATLAB /Simulink which will represent the 
three phase induction motor including a three phase to d-q axis transformations. The main benefit with 
MATLAB Simulink is that in the electromechanical dynamic model can be accomplished in a simple way and it 
can be simulated faster using function blocks
